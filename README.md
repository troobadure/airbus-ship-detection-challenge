Kaggle challenge


Important to notice that we have dataset in run-length encoding format, notebooks contain decoders which are based on Link to Kaggle Notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/paulorzp/run-length-encode-and-decode.

We need to create an input directory in the root of repository named 'input'). Then put there two subfolders 'train_v2' and 'test_v2'.

Next download dataset from kaggle: tap here. And unzip it in that two subfolders according to their names.
